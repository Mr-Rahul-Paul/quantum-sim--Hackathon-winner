## Overview

This project simulates Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) equations for molecular structures. It provides an interactive interface for quantum chemistry simulations.
This project won us HackIIIT.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js (Frontend Framework)
- Framer Motion (Animations)
- TypeScript
- IBM Quantum Computing APIs
- AI Model Integration

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mr-Rahul-Paul/quantum-sim-HackIIITV
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Technical Details

- Backend communicates with IBM's quantum computing servers via POST requests
- AI model trained on mock molecular data for enhanced predictions
- Real-time simulation results visualization
- Optimized for quantum chemistry calculations

## Architecture

The system uses a TypeScript-based API layer for improved UX and deployment efficiency. The backend processes quantum calculations and interfaces with IBM's quantum computing infrastructure.

## Team Collaboration

This project was developed as a team effort for HackIIIT. Original project files and documentation can be found in our [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/DhRUVwol/quantum-hackathon.git).
