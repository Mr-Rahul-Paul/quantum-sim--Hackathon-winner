## Project Overview

Our platform enables users to:
- Simulate molecular energy curves using quantum algorithms like VQE (Variational Quantum Eigensolver).
- Predict molecular behavior using a trained machine learning model.
- Visualize molecular structures and energy plots.
- Explore curated lists of elements and molecules with detailed insights.

This project was developed during a hackathon by **Team Bytes**.

## Features

- **Quantum Simulations**: Leverage IBM Quantum services or local simulators to compute molecular properties.
- **Machine Learning Predictions**: Predict molecular behavior based on complexity, qubits, and other features.
- **Interactive UI**: A user-friendly interface to explore curated molecules and run simulations.
- **Caching**: Efficient caching of results to reduce redundant computations.
- **Visualization**: Generate molecular images and energy plots for better understanding.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or later)
- Python (v3.9 or later)
- MongoDB (for caching simulation results)
- IBM Quantum API Token (optional for quantum hardware simulations)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/quantum-molecule-simulator.git
   cd quantum-molecule-simulator
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
